# Contacts
## Contact Manager App with KMM, MVI, and Jetpack Compose.

The app allows users to add, view, edit, and delete contacts. It works on both Android and iOS platforms, sharing a significant portion of the codebase, which helps in reducing development time and maintenance efforts.

## Features

- Edit existing contacts to update their information.
- Delete unwanted contacts from the list.
